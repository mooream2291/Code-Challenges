// 'use strict'

// algorithm

// declare a function that takes in two strings

//  split each character in the strings

//  comparisons to make:

//  does a character exist more than once in string 1

//  does a character exist more than once in string 2

//  do the dupes exist at the same indices in each string?

//  iterate through string 1 and store it in a hash map

//  iterate through string 2 and compare the current index to the key in the map, IF the key already exists, nothing will happen, IF it doesn't the value will be replaced.

// CODE:

// function isIsomorphic  (s, t) {

//  s.split("")
// }
